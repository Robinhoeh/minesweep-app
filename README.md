#Add Player Interactivity
##You've made it to the fourth part of the JavaScript Minesweeper project. Take a minute to review what you accomplished in the third part. You:

-Wrote a function to generate a player board
-Wrote a function to generate a bomb board and randomly place bombs on the board
-Refactored the printBoard() function
-In this part of the project, you'll polish minesweeper.js by doing the following:

Refactoring the generateBombBoard() function so that it doesn't add duplicate bombs
Writing a function to retrieve the number of bombs adjacent to the square that has been "clicked" by a player
Building a function that will let a player "click", or "flip", a tile on the board
You should expect to write about 40 new lines of code in this part of the project, bringing the total to around 90 lines of code in minesweeper.js.
